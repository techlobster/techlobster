## Thank you for your time. Welcome to my GitHub page. I am primarily learning Analytics and Software Engineering because it has always been interesting to listen to customers, leaders, and team members working together to create new possibilities. There has been a focus on studying CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Excel, Python, and Tableau along with foundational knowledge in Jira as well as AWS along with genuine curiosity in learning new technologies beyond this. I have sales, customer service, financial services, e-commerce, and tech support background which I believe is a unique combination that seeks to understand many diverse perspectives and user personas when solving IT and business problems. This GitHub is an ongoing work in progress. I looking forward to learning from this global community.
